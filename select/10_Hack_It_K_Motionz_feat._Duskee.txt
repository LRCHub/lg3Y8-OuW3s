Hack it (Hack it)
Hack it (Hack it)
Hack it (Hack it)
They say how do you manage?
They talk alot but can they... Hack it,
Sending it for six of the planet,
I was measuring the distance till it vanished,
A pessimistic vision made me panic,
But lessons of the wisdom saved the madness,
The man is above the average,
Mission elevate the masses,
Listen to your intuition seperate the assets,
Land full of wonders name it Alice,
Resonating shanties of her palace.
They talk a lot but can they... hack it
They talk a lot but can they... hack it
They talk alot but can they... hack it
Lucid when i'm dreamng on the matress,
Grew for no reason 'round the atlas
[?] was booming it on campus,
Soon to see the unity attach us,
The love will catch us,
If you really line your chakras,
But something tells me that this generation might be active,
Tunnel vision steady through the chapters,
See, we're never going backwards,
They talk a lot but can the... hack it
Hack it
Hack it
Hack it
[?] with the damage,
They say, how do you manage,
I say I reach out and grab it,
They talk, a lot but can they... hack it,
Sending it for six of the planet,
I was measuring the distance till it vanished,
A pessimistic vision make me panic,
But lessons of the wisdom saved,
The man is above average,
Mission elevate the masses,
Listen to your intuition seperate the assets,
Land full of wonders name it Alice,
Resonating shanties of her palace,
They talk a lot but can they... hack it
They talk a lot but can they... hack it
Lucid when i'm dreaming on the mattress,
Grew for no reason 'round the atlas
[?] was booming it on a campus,
Soon to see the unity attach us,
The love will catch us,
If you really line your chakras,
But something tells me that this generation might be active,
Tunnel vision steady through the chapters,
See, we're never going backwards,
They tallk a lot but can they... hack it
